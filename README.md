# Handicap-Tracker-2.3

This is a mobile app for android that allows the user to input golf courses they played into a list building their own database. Then they
can select a course and tees they played that day, enter their score for the round and the app will calculate their current golf index based off 
of the GHIN handicap system. It also tracks stats such as how their handicap has evolved over time and their trends at specific golf courses
